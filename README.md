## Web Logbook Mobile

This mobile application is a sort of addon to the main [Web Logbook](https://github.com/vsimakhin/web-logbook/). The app is written in the Flutter framework and Dart programming language, using ChatGPT.

The synchronization with the main application is bidirectional. So any changes on one or the other side should be synced. You can use as many mobile apps as you want.

## Changelog
